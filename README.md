# Bell-Pepper

## Bell Pepper Disease Detection using CNN
Welcome to my first research project on the detection of black spots, a major disease affecting bell peppers, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project aims to achieve high accuracy in identifying and classifying black spots on bell peppers.

## Dataset
I have curated a comprehensive dataset, named Pepperbell, which includes images of bell peppers affected by various diseases, with a focus on black spots. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating the CNN model.

## Key Features
### Disease Identification:
  The CNN model excels at accurately identifying black spots, a prominent disease in bell peppers.
### High Accuracy: 
  The model has been trained to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy and diseased bell peppers.
